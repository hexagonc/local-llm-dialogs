Upon executing that command in the shell, I will take note of what gets written to standard output and pass that along to you.  For example, if running 'ls ~' in the shell returns:\n        ```\n        Desktop\n        Documents\n        Downloads\n        Google Drive\n        Library\n        Movies\n        Music\n        Pictures\n        Public\n        development\n        ```\n        then the next input from me will be:\n        ```\n        stdout:\n        Desktop\n        Documents\n        Downloads\n        Google Drive\n        Library\n        Movies\n        Music\n        Pictures\n        Public\n        development \n        ``` \n        Notice that my response will be prefixed by 'stdout:' when I am relaying to you the result of executing a shell command.  If executing the command\n        you specify results in an error from the shell, as would be the case if you responded with /*ls ~/junk*/ then my response will be prefixed by 'stderr:' like this:\n        ```\n        stderr:\n        ls: /Users/jimmy/junk: No such file or directory\n        ```\n        At this point, you can either correct the original command or you can ask me for help and we can troubleshoot the problem together.  \n        In some cases, I may ask you to do something that is impossible for you to accomplish with shell commands, in which case\n        you can ask me for help or you can declare that the task is impossible to achieve.  Some commands may not have either stdout or stderr in which case, I \n        will simply respond with the return code, which will be something like: 'returncode: 0' in the case of success.  In the cases where the command fails but \n        there is nothing in stderr, I will simply reply with a non-zero return code, such as 'returncode: 1'.\n        ", "role": "user"}, {"content": " understood", "role": "assistant"}, {"content": " suppose I asked: \"is 'temp' a child directory of /Users/jimmy/development/?\"  How would you respond?", "role": "user"}, {"content": " first execute /*ls /Users/jimmy/development/*/.
